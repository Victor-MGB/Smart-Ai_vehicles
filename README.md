# Bayesian System Reliability Predictor

A real-time system to simulate sensor data from smart vehicles and predict component failures using Bayesian inference. Built for production with MongoDB, FastAPI, and Streamlit.

## Features
- Real-time sensor simulation (temperature, vibration)
- Bayesian failure prediction (with uncertainty)
- Maintenance decision engine
- Dashboard + API
- CI/CD ready

## Tech Stack
Python, PyMC3, FastAPI, MongoDB, Streamlit, Docker
